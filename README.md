# integrate Alm~F(phi).|Ylm|^2
Small program for integrating Alm in C++ using Gaussian Legendre Quadrature


This code is for calculating Alm as defined in Gizon 2002, AN, 323, 251â€“253
It allows you to evaluate for any kind of assumed active region function F(phi) the induced perturbation. See specific cases of polar or equatorial active bands in Gizon, 2002.

# How to use
This version run a small test program contained in the main() of activity.cpp.
To run that test, use cmake to compile into a build directory:
       'mkdir build'
       'cd build'
       'cmake ..'
       'make'

This will generate an executable with parameters as per defined into the main() of activity.cpp
Note that this main is just for tests. A proper usage would require to include activity.cpp into a larger projet, after commenting the main().
