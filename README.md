# integrate Glm~|Ylm|^2
Small program for integrating |Ylm|^2 in C++ using Gaussian Legendre Quadrature


This code is for calculating Glm as defined in Gizon 2002, AN, 323, 251â€“253
It is implemented with explicit limitation to l<=3

# How to use
[1] If not available install the libIntegrate library in the root directory: 
       
       git clone https://github.com/CD3/libIntegrate
       
[2] Use cmake to compile into a build directory:

       mkdir build
       cd build
       cmake ..
       make

This will generate an executable with parameters as per defined into the main() of ylm.cpp
Note that this main is just for tests. A proper usage would require to include ylm.cpp into a larger projet,
after commenting the main().
